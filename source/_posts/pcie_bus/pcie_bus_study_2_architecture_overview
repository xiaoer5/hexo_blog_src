introduction to the PCI Express data transfer protocol.

- The layered approach to PCI Express device design

- describe the function of each device layer



PCI Express employs **packets** to accomplish data transfers between devices.

root complex <== communication ==> endpoint

endpoint <== communication ==> endpoint

Communication involves the transmission and reception of packets called **TLP**(Transaction Layer packets)
